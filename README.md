# Clean Architecture Web API with .NET Core 8

This project demonstrates how to build a Clean Architecture Web API using .NET Core 8. Clean Architecture is a design pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability by organizing the application into layers.

## Overview
The Clean Architecture pattern divides the application into four main layers:
1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic and entities.
2. **Application Layer**: Implements use cases and application-specific business rules.
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns like database access, file I/O, and third-party services.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Exposes the API endpoints and handles HTTP requests and responses.

This project uses .NET Core 8 to implement a Web API following these principles.
